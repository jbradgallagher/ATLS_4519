It is time for Iran to face serious consequences. This regime is a threat to our national security.
@ BarackObama is holding Taiwan's request for 66 advanced F-16's. Wrong message to send to China.

Why is crude oil priced at $86/Barrel? OPEC is ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel. America needs new leaders.
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
Why did @ BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security.

Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC: American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.

"Captured or not
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
"All he does is go on television is talk
I will make this right for our great Vets!
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.

"Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor
"Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling
"Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?"
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
"The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
"...and did not want to ""rock the boat."" He didn't ""choke
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...

Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!
